Euler problem 4: https://projecteuler.net/problem=4[].

.Palindromic numbers
****
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number[Palindromic numbers] are numbers that read the same forwards and backwards.

Examples of palindromic numbers include:
- 4
- 99
- 5335

== Python

.Task
****
Assume a single command-line argument, a positive integer $n$ in the range $1 \le n \le 4$.

Write a python script named `euler-4-largest-palindrome-product.py` which writes the largest palindromic number that is
the product of two $n$ digit numbers to standard output.

Upload your solution to https://euler.computing.dcu.ie/einstein/[_Einstein_].
****

.Example invocation
----
$ python3 euler-4-largest-palindrome-product.py 1
----

.Example standard output
----
9
----

.Explanation
****
The largest palindromic product of two 1-digit numbers is $9 \times 1 = 9$.
It may be counter intuitive, but all single digit numbers are palindromes.
****

.Example invocation
----
$ python3 euler-4-largest-palindrome-product.py 2
----

.Example standard output
----
9009
----

.Explanation
****
The largest palindromic product of two 2-digit numbers is $99 \times 91 = 9009$.
Note that the answer isn't $9999$, because it can't be represented as a product of two 2-digit numbers.
