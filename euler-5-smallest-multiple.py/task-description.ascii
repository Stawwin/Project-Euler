= Euler 5

****
Euler problem 5: https://projecteuler.net/problem=5[].
****

.Least common multiple (LCM)
****
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple[Least Common Multiple], or LCM,
of a sequence of numbers is the lowest number that can be evenly divided by each number
in the sequence.

For example, the LCM of $2$, $3$ and $4$ is $12$.

The most important point to note is that multiplying the numbers in the sequence
together doesn't necessarily give the LCM. In the above sequence, this would be
$2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24$, which is incorrect.

== Python

.Task
****
Assume a single command-line argument, a positive integer $n$, where $n \ge 2$.

Write a python script named `euler-5-smallest-multiple.py` which writes the LCM of $1, 2, 3, ..., n$
to standard output.

Upload your solution to https://euler.computing.dcu.ie/einstein/[_Einstein_].

.Example invocation
----
$ python3 euler-5-smallest-multiple.py 4
----

.Example standard output
----
12
----

.Explanation
****
The lowest number evenly divisible by $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$ is 12.
